        details: "Escape is currently my most recent Unreal project. The purpose of the game is to find two keys in a mansion in order to escape it. The aim of the project was to learn more about using textures and mateerials in Unreal, as well as linking actions together, adding sounds and listeners to the level, hence why the story itself may seem a little uninteresting compared to the mechanics involved.",

To win the game, the played needs to identify a randomly-selected isogram based on how many bulls (corretly placed letters) and cows (correct letters in the wrong place) they can find.",

        details: "I created this app because of a personal vendetta against writing grocery lists. I deeply dislike looking at all the recipes that I want to cook over  a week and translating the quantities to how much I actually need for each product. With this application, I want to create a way to make a meal plan over the course of a customisable number of days for a custom number of people and return the grocery list with what needs to be bought to stick to the plan. I have a lot of ideas on how to tackle the project, but first I want to learn the foundations of React.js before shifting to React Native.",

        details: "My introductory chapter to gameplay programming in Unreal, this project was pointed as either newcomers to C++ as an introduction to the language or to more advanced coders as a warmup challenge. I created the project as a warmup and to rekindle my love for C++, a language that has been in my suite since the early age of 15. The goal of the game is to guess a list of numbers in each level, based on a few mathematics-based clues. All the numbers are generated by the code itself, the only hardcoded bit is the story of the game.",

Mystery is a text-based RPG, but it is very different from The Enchanted Chest. Inspired from Bethesda's Dishonored, the game tells the story of a detective who sneaks into a masked party to arrest one of the three hosts. In the house, there are clues pointing to the right host. Make your arrest correctly and you win, otherwise you lose.",
