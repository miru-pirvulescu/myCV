I deeply dislike looking at all the recipes that I want to cook over  a week and translating the quantities to how much I actually need for each product. With this application, I want to create a way to make a meal plan over the course of a customisable number of days for a custom number of people and return the grocery list with what needs to be bought to stick to the plan. I have a lot of ideas on how to tackle the project, but first I want to learn the foundations of React.js before shifting to React Native."
