                description="Throughout the length on my undergraduate studies, I have been taking part in a number of hackathons organised by both student organisations and companies. Such hackathons include HackKing's (Organised by King's College London Technology Society), or Code For Good (organised by JPMorgan Chase). These events helped me learn more about the world of tech through the projects that I developed, such as Python and a little bit of Swift while creating an app that makes a trail through a supermarket in order to efficiently do the groceries."

                description="While I love participating at hackathons, there is also a lot of fun in organising them! I had the opportunity to volunteer for hosting the 2017 edition of HackKing's, hosted at BlackRock's office in London, where I helped participants with checking in, I set up the dining area at meal times, and I made our sponsors' stay as welcoming as possible, and I tended to the needs of all our guests. Later, in 2019, I helped the hackathon organisation committee wit finding a venue, setting up the coding areas, and cleaning up after all the guests left."

                description="During my industrial placement, I enjoyed an occasional volunteering opportunity provided by my local communities. In these activities I hosted a boat tea party for the elder residents of my area  to help combat loneliness, I aided a dog shelter by renovating a small portion of their property and making toys for the 'locals', and I helped organise  HackKing's 2019 as mentioned earlier."

                description="While I was in high-school, I was part of an NGO called Interact Club Timisoara, an organisation composed of young people between the ages of 14 and 19 who organised charity events benefiting various groups. Some of these projects included a handmade decoration sale as a fundraiser for the refurbishment of a school, a concert aiding a young girl in need of surgery, and a book donation for a remote library. As the organisation had country-spread clubs, twice a year we would participate in conferences, meeting other clubs and sharing our experiences."

                description="One of the most remarkable projects that I have been involved with is the GROW project, which was managed by AIESEC Timisoara. This event was spread over 10 weeks in which foreign mentors would come to our city to teach us about personal growth and things that you cannot learn in schools, such as how to find your personal values and how to interpret certain types of behabiour. The organisation offered me the position of ambassador after a successful interview where I got to meet and network with the team."
